\section{Definitions}
% \begin{theorem}
%   Let $A \subset \reals^n$ and $o$ an open cover of $A$.
%   Then there is countable collection $\Phi$ of $C^\infty$ 
%   functions $\varphi$ defined on $A$ with the following properties:
%   \begin{enumerate}
%     \item For any $x \in A$, $0 \leq \varphi(x) \leq 1$.
%     \item For any $x \in A$ there is an open set $V$ containing $x$ 
%     such that all but finitely many $\varphi$ are zero on $V$.
%     \item For each $x \in A$, we have $\sum_\Phi \varphi(x) = 1$ and 
%     by (2) this sum is finite in some open set around $x$.
%     \item For each $\varphi \in \Phi$ there is an open set $U \in o$
%     such that $\varphi = 0$ outisde some closed set contained in $U$ 
%     (the support of each $\varphi$ is compact and contained in some 
%     $U \in o$.)
%   \end{enumerate}

%   A colletion satisfying (1) - (3) is called a $C^\infty$ partition of unity for $A$.
%   If it also satisfies (4) it is said to be subordinate to the cover $o$.
% \end{theorem}

% \vspace{2em}


% \begin{definition}
%   Let $o$ be an admissible open cover of an open set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^n$
%   (each $U \in o$ is contained in $A$) and $\Phi$ a partition of unity 
%   subordinate to $o$.  If $f: A \to \reals$ is bounded in some 
%   open set around each point in $A$ and the subset of $A$ where $f$
%   is discontinuous is measure zero then, each 
%   $\int_A \varphi \cdot f$ exists.
%   If the series $\sum_\Phi \int_A \varphi \cdot |f|$ converges 
%   then we say $f$ is integrable write 
%   $\int_A f = \sum_\Phi \int_A \varphi \cdot f$.
% \end{definition}



\subsection{Tensors}
\begin{definition}
  A $k-$tensor is a multilinear map from 
  $V^k \to \reals$ where $V$ is a vector space.
  The set of all $k$-tensors is denoted $\mathfrak{T}^k(V)$.
  If $S \in \mathfrak{T}^k(V)$ and $T \in \mathfrak{T}^l(V)$
  define a tensor-product:
  \begin{align*}
    S \otimes T (v_1, ..., v_k, v_{k+1}, ..., v_{k+l}) = 
    S(v_1, ..., v_k)\cdot T(v_{k+1}, ..., v_{k+l}).
  \end{align*}
  This product is left and right distributive and associative if addition is defined the obvious way.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $v_1, ..., v_n$ be a basis for $V$, and let 
  $\varphi_1, ..., \varphi_n$ be the dual basis, $\varphi_i(v_j) = \delta_{ij}.$
  Then the set of all 
  \begin{align*}
    \varphi_{i_1} \otimes ... \otimes \varphi_{i_k}, \ \ 1 \leq i_1 \leq ... \leq i_k \leq n
  \end{align*}
  is a basis for $\mathfrak{T}^k(V)$, which therefore has dimension $n^k.$
\end{theorem}


\begin{definition}
  A $k$-tensor is alternating if
  \begin{align*}
    a(v_1, ..., v_i, v_j, ..., v_k) = -a(v_1, ..., v_j, v_i, ..., v_k)
  \end{align*}
  i.e. two elements are swapped and the rest left alone.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  If $T$ is some $k$-tensor, 
  then you can have an alternating tensor for free:
  \begin{align*}
    Alt(T) = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma \in S_k} sign(\sigma)
      T(v_{\sigma1}, ..., v_{\sigma k})
  \end{align*}
  where $S_k$ is the group of permutations on $k$ letters.
\end{definition}

In general, the tensor product of two alternating tensors is not likely to be alternating.  Enter the wedge:


\begin{definition}
  Let $\omega \in \Omega^k(V)$ and $\nu \in \Omega^l(V)$.
  Then
  \begin{align*}
    \omega \wedge \nu = \frac{(k+l)!}{k!l!}Alt(\omega \otimes \nu)
  \end{align*}
  is in $\Omega^{k+l}(V).$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Fields and Forms}
\begin{definition}
  For $p \in \reals^n$ the tangent space of $\reals^n$ at $p$ is the set of all $(p, v), v \in \reals^n$.
  Write $v_p$ and say `the vector $v$ at $p$.'
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  The tangent space inherits the inner product from $\reals^n$, by defining 
  \begin{align*}
    \langle v_p, w_p \rangle_p  = \langle v, w \rangle.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  For the standard orientation in $\reals^n_p$, the sensible choice is
  \begin{align*}
    [(e_1)_p, ..., (e_n)_p].
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A vector field $F$ is a function such that 
  \begin{align*}
    F(p) \in \reals^n_p
  \end{align*}
  for every $p \in \reals^n.$  The component functions of $F$ are the functions 
  $F_i: \reals^n \to \reals$ such that 
  \begin{align*}
    F(p) = F_1(p)\cdot(e_1)_p + ... + F_n(p)\cdot(e_n)_p.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A $k-$form or differential form is a function on $\reals^n$ such that
  \begin{align*}
    \omega(p) \in \Omega^k(\reals^n_p).
  \end{align*}
  A $0-$form $f$ takes a vector $p$ and returns a tensor of rank $0$, that is a number.
  Hence a $f$ is considered a function from $\reals^n$ to $\reals.$
  Forms inherit the operations
  \begin{align*}
    (\omega + \mu)(p) &= \omega(p) + \mu(p)\\
    (f \cdot \omega)(p)(v_1, ...v_k) &= f(p) \cdot \omega(p)(v_1, ..., v_k)\\
    (\omega \wedge \mu)(p)(v_1, ..., v_k) &= \omega(p)(v_1,...v(k)) \wedge \mu(p)(v_1, ..., v_k).
  \end{align*}
  If $\varphi_1(p), ..., \varphi_n(p)$ is the dual basis to $(e_1)_p, ..., (e_n)_p$ then any $k$-form can be written as
  \begin{align*}
    \omega(p) = \sum_{i_1<...<i_k} \omega_{i_1, ..., i_k}(p)\cdot[\varphi_{i_1}(p)\wedge...\wedge\varphi_{i_k}(p)]
  \end{align*}
  for numbers $\omega{i_1,...,i_k}$.  The form $\omega$ is said to be continuous if each of these functions is.

  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    If $f$ is a $0-$form (a function $\reals^n \to \reals$) define a $1-$form $df$, the  `differential of $f$ at $p$' by
    \begin{align*}
      df(p)(v_p) = Df(p)(v).
    \end{align*}
    For example, writing $x^i$ for the projection map $\pi^i$ we have 
    \begin{align*}
      dx^i(p)(v_p) = Dx^i(p)(v) = v^i
    \end{align*}
    and so $dx^1(p), ..., dx^n(p)$ is the dual basis to $(e_1)_p, ..., (e_n)_p.$ 
    In particular, $df$ in this basis is 
    \begin{align*}
      df(p)(v_p) = D_1f(p) \cdot dx^1(p)(v_p) + .... + D_nf(p)\cdot dx^n(p)(v_p)
    \end{align*}
    or without arguments 
    \begin{align*}
      df = D_1f\cdot dx^1 + .... + D_nf \cdot dx^n.
    \end{align*}
  \end{definition}


  \begin{definition}
    If $f: \reals^n \to \reals^m$ is differentiable define the transformation induced by $f$ as
    \begin{align*}
      f_*(v_p) = (Df(p)(v))_{f(p)}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    For $f$ as above we have $f_* : \reals^n_p \to \reals^m_{f(p)}$. 
    Write $f^*$ for the dual map\footnote{How can this be made precise?}
    , i.e. if $T \in \Omega^k(\reals^n_f(p))$ then
    \begin{align*}
      f^* : \Omega^k(\reals^m_{f(p)}) &\to \Omega^k(\reals^n_p)\\
      f^*(T)(v_1, ..., v_k) &= T(f_*(v_1), ..., f_*(v_k)).
    \end{align*}
    If $\omega$ is a $k$-form on $\reals^m$ define the $k$-form $f^*\omega$ on $\reals^n$ by $f^*\omega(p) = f^*(\omega(f(p))).$
    To be explicit, 
    \begin{align*}
     f^*(\omega(p))(v_1, ..., v_k) &= \omega(f(p))(f_*(v_1), ..., f_*(v_k)).      
    \end{align*} 
  \end{definition}


  % \begin{theorem}
  %   If $f: \reals^n \to \reals^m$ is differentiable, then
  %   \begin{enumerate}
  %     \item $f^*(dx^i) = \sum_{j=1}^nD_jf^i \cdot dx^j$
  %     \item $f^*(\omega + \mu) = f^*(\omega) + f^*(\mu)$
  %     \item $f^*(g \cdot \omega) = (f \circ \omega) \cdot f^*\omega$
  %     \item $f^*(\omega \wedge \mu) = f^*(\omega) \wedge f^*(\mu)$
  %   \end{enumerate}
  % \end{theorem}


  \begin{definition}
    Let $\omega$ be a $k$-form:
    \begin{align*}
      \omega = \sum_{i_1 < ... < i_k} \omega_{i_1,...,i_k}dx^{i_1} \wedge ... \wedge dx^{i_k}.
    \end{align*}
    Define the `differential of $\omega$' by 
    \begin{align*}
      d\omega = 
      \sum_{i_1 < ... < i_k} d\omega_{i_1,...,i_k}dx^{i_1} \wedge ... \wedge dx^{i_k} = 
      \sum_{i_1 < ... < i_k} \sum_{\alpha = 1}^n D_\alpha \omega_{i_1,...,i_k}  \cdot dx^\alpha \wedge dx^{i_1}\wedge ... \wedge dx^{i_k}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  A form $\omega$ is called closed if $d\omega = 0$ and exact if $\omega = d\mu$ for some $\mu. $
\end{definition} 




 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 



 

\subsection{Chains}

\begin{definition}
   A singular $n$-cube in $A \subset \reals^m$ is a continuous function from 
   $[0,1]^n$ to $A$.  Let $\reals^0$ and $[0,1]^0$ denote $\{0\}$.
   Then a singular $0$-cube is a function from $\{0\}$ to $A$, that is a point 
   in $A$.
   A singular $1$-cube is often called a curve.
\end{definition}
\color{Blue}
The book defines a $n$-cubes as a function from $[0, 1]^n$ to a subset of 
Euclidean space of the same dimension.  This seems to be an error, for the following reason.
The definition of a singular $0$-cube is given as a function from $\{0\}$ to $A$, which 
must therefore be a subset of $\reals^0$, i.e. the only 
singular $0$-cube is the function $c: \{0\} \to \{0\}$, definitely at odds with the 
language of \textit{a} singular $0$-cube.
Similarly the definition of a curve as a singular $1$-cube is unnatural if 
the codomain is only one dimensional.
\color{Black}

\begin{definition}
  The standard $n$-cube $I^n$ is the identity restricted to $[0, 1]^n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Let $S$ be the set of all $n$-cubes in $A$.  An $n$-chain in $A$ is a function
  $f: S \to \integers$ such that all but finitely many cubes are mapped to zero.
  Define $f + g$ by $(f+g)(c) = f(c) + g(c)$ and $nf(c) = n \cdot f(c)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Starting with the standard $n$-cube define, for each 
  $1 \leq i \leq n$, the $(i, 0)$ and $(i, 1)$ faces as the following
  functions on $[0, 1]^{n-1}$
  \begin{align*}
    I^n_{(i,0)}(x) = I^n(x^1, ..., x^{i-1}, 0, x^i, ..., x^{n-1}) \\
    I^n_{(i,1)}(x) = I^n(x^1, ..., x^{i-1}, 1, x^i, ..., x^{n-1}) \\
  \end{align*}
  Define the boundary of the standard $n$-cube as 
  \begin{align*}
    \partial I^n = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\alpha = 0, 1} (-1)^{i + \alpha}I^n_{(i, \alpha)}.
  \end{align*}
  For a general singular $n$-cube $c: [0, 1]^n \to A$ define the $(i, \alpha)$ faces as 
  $c_{(i, \alpha)} = c \circ I^n_{(i, \alpha)}$
  and the boundary of $c$ as 
  \begin{align*}
    \partial c = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{\alpha = 0, 1} (-1)^{i + \alpha}c_{(i, \alpha)}.
  \end{align*}
  Finally define the boundary of a sum (i.e. a chain) as the sum of the boundaries:
  \begin{align*}
    \partial \sum a_ic_i = \sum a_i \partial c_i.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}

  

















































































\section{Issues}

These are incomplete/problematic:
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3.10 Would like a proof using the notions developed here rather than 
  topological facts.
  \item 3.11, 3.12, 3.19, 3.25, 3.28, 3.29, 3.31, 3.40, 3.41 Needs proof.
  \item Still not sure I understand what 3.21 is getting at.  Is it asking for a partition 
  which doesn't contain any rectangles in $A-C$? If so its easy to 
  draw JM sets with two connected components which seem to break this idea.
  \item 3.33 (b) straight up makes no sense. $f$ is defined on $[a, b] \times [c, d]$
  and $G(x)$ is defined, nonsensically, as $\int_a^{g(x)}f(t, x)dt$.
  \item Be more clear on the hypothesis of Fubinis for switching order in 3.35.
  \item 3-37 (b) is reportedly broken. Still needs doing with an improved 
  hypothesis.
  \item 4.4 might need a better comment on orientation.
  \item Almost all the problems on tensors...
  \item Fix the brackets in 4.13.
\end{itemize}

It would be good to check whether an argument about absolute convergence should ever be made explicitly.  

In other proofs Lemma 3.1 is used generously, in the sense that if $(P')$ 
is a family of partitions subject to some condition which does not restrict the
`fine-ness' of $P'$
then each $P'$ is a refinement of some generic partition and so any result 
involving an infinumum/suprememum over all partitions holds equally well over
the restricted set of partitions.  Would be good to clear this up.

Personally I think the original statement 3.21 is pretty confusing.  It could 
state explicitly that the partition contains no subrectangles contained in $A-C.$

\section{Problems}

\begin{problem}{3.1}
  Let $f: [0,1] \times [0, 1] \to \reals$ be defined by
 \begin{equation*}
    f(x, y) =
    \begin{cases*}
      0 & if $0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2}$ \\
      1 & if $ \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 1 $.
    \end{cases*}
  \end{equation*}
Then $f$ is integrable and the value of the integral is $\frac{1}{2}.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  For $\varepsilon > 0$ let $P_\varepsilon$ be the partition with subrectangles 
  \begin{align*}
    S_1 &= [0, \frac{1}{2} - \frac{\varepsilon}{4}] \times [0, 1] \\
    S_2 &= [\frac{1}{2} -\frac{\varepsilon}{4}, \frac{1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{4}] \times [0, 1] \\
    S_3 &= [\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{4}, 1] \times [0, 1]
   \end{align*}
   Then 
   $U(f, P_\varepsilon) - L(f, P_\varepsilon)$ = $\dfrac{\varepsilon}{2} < \varepsilon$ 
   i.e. $f$ is integrable
   and $\int f = \inf U(f, P_\varepsilon) = \frac{1}{2}.$
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.2}
  Let $f: A \to \reals$ be integrable and $g = f$ except at finitely many points.
  Then $g$ is integrable and $\int f = \int g.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $f$ and $g$ differ except at a single point $x$.
  Let $P$ be some partition fine enough that $x$ lies in a single 
  subrectangle $S$. Then
  $$(U-L)(g, P) = (U-L)(f, P) + (M_S-m_S)(g-f)\cdot v(S)$$
  can be made arbitrarily small, as the term $(U-L)(f, P)$ vanishes by 
  integrability of $f$ and the other term can be made as small
  as we like by insiting that the rectangle $S$ is sufficiently small. 
  Furthermore if $g(x) > f(x)$ then 
  \begin{align*}
    \int g = \inf [U(g, P)] = \inf[ U(f, P) + (M_S(g - f)\cdot v(S))] = \inf[U(f, P)] = \int f
  \end{align*}
  with a similar argument for when $g(x) < f(x).$  
  Repetition of the argument proves the result for a finite collection of 
  points.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.3 Linearity of the Integral.}
  Let $f, g: A \to \reals$ be integrable.
  Then $\int f+g  = \int f + \int g$ and $\int cf =c\int f$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Since 
  $$m_S(f) + m_S(g) \leq f(x) + g(x) \ \ \forall x \in S$$
  it follows that
  $$m_S(f) + m_S(g) \leq \inf_{S}(f + g) = m_S(f + g).$$
  Then $L(f, P) + L(g, P) \leq L(f + g, P)$ follows easily and by a similar argument 
  $U(f + g, P) \leq U(f, P) + U(g, P).$  Hence the differece 
  $(U-L)(f + g, P)$ is bounded from above by $(U-L)(f, P) + (U-L)(g, P)$ 
  which vanishes by integrability of $f$ and $g$.

  To compute the value of the integral, 
  \begin{align*}
    \int f + \int g = \sup L(f, P) + \sup L(g, P) = \sup[ L(f, P) + L(g, P) ] 
    \leq \sup L (f + g, P) = \int f + g \\
    \int f + \int g = \inf U(f, P) + \inf U(g, P) = \inf[ U(f, P) + U(f, P) ]
    \geq \inf U(f + g, P) = \int f + g
  \end{align*}
  and so $\inf f + \int g = \int f + g.$

  Finally for constants $c$, 
  \begin{align*}
    \inf U(cf, P) = c \inf U(f, P) = c \sup L(f, P) = \sup L(cf, P)
  \end{align*}
  i.e $cf$ is integrable with the value 
  $\int cf = \inf U(cf, P) = c \inf U(f, P) = c \int f.$
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}{3.4}
  Let $f: A\to \reals$ and let $P$ be a partition of $A$. Then $f$ is integrable
  if and only if the restriction of $f$ to each subrectangle is integrable, 
  and in this case $\int_A f = \sum_P \int_S f|_S.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let the $n$ subrectangles of $P$ be $S_i$ and suppose that each $f|_{S_i}$ is integrable.
  Then for any $\varepsilon > 0$ and each $i$ there is a partitions $P_i$ of $S_i$ such that 
  $(U - L)(f|_{S_i}, P_i) <\varepsilon / n.$
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{S_i \in P} \sum_{S_{ij} \in P_i} [ (M_{S_{ij}} - m_{S_{ij}})(f|S_i)\cdot v(S_{ij}) ] < 
    \varepsilon \Longrightarrow 
    \sum_{S_i \in P} \sum_{S_{ij} \in P_i} [ (M_{S_{ij}} - m_{S_{ij}})(f)\cdot v(S_{ij}) ] < 
    \varepsilon
  \end{align*}
  where the latter double sum is $(U - L)f$ over the partition formed by taking the union of
  all the $P_i.$  Hence $f$ is integrable.

  On the other hand for any rectangle $S \in P$  we have
  $$(U-L)(f|_S, S) = (U-L)(f, S) \leq (U - L)(f, P)$$
  since $U-L$ is non-negative and $S$ is containined in $P$. 
  If $f$ is integrable then the RHS can be made arbitrarily small by refining $P$, 
  in which case $S$ may need to be replaced by the part of that refinement which 
  covers it, $S = \cup P'$. Then $(U-L)(f|_S, P')$ vanishes and so $f|_S$
  is integrable.

  To compute the integral we have, for partitions $P_S$ of each $S$
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_P \int_{S} f|_S = 
    \sum_P \sup [L(f|_S, P_S)] = 
    \sup \bigg[\sum_P L(f|_S, P_s)\bigg] = 
    \sup \bigg[\sum_P \sum_{P_i} m_{S_ij}(f)\cdot v(S_{ij}) \bigg].
  \end{align*}
  The last term is the supremum over partitions $P'$ which are generic partitions
  of $A$ but for the refinement that each rectangle must be contained in one of the
  original $S \in P.$  
  Hence the supremum over such partitions coincides with the supremum over generic ones
  and so $\sum \int f|_S = \int f.$
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.5}
  Let $g, f: A \to \reals$ be integrable and suppose $f \leq g$.  
  Then $\int f \leq \int g.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
  \int f \ =
  \ \ \inf \sum M_S(f) \cdot v(S)\ \  \leq 
  \ \ \inf \sum M_S(g) \cdot v(S) \ \ = 
  \ \int g.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}
  If $f: A \to \reals$ is integrable then $|f|$ is integrable and
  $\big | \int f \big | \leq \int |f|.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    (U-L)(|f|, P) = \sum (M_S(|f|) - m_S(|f|))\cdot v(S) 
    \leq \sum (M_S(f) - m_S(f))\cdot v(S)
  \end{align*}
  which is as small as we like by integrability of $f$. The required comparison
  follows from taking infinums of

\begin{problem}{3.8}
  The rectangle $A = \Pi [a_i, b_i] \subset \reals^m$ 
  does not have content zero if each $a_i < b_i.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U_1, ..., U_n$ be a finite cover of closed rectangles with each $U_i$ contained in $A$ and
  let $P_d = (a_d = t_{d0} < ... < t_{dk(d)} = b_d)$ be the partition containing all 
  the endpoints of $U_i$ in the $d$th dimension, $d = 1,..,m$.
  Then each $v(U_i) = \Pi_{d=1}^m \sum ( t_{d,j} - t_{d,j-1} )$ for a 
  `certain number' of summands.
  Moreover each $\Pi_{d=1}^m(t_{d,j} - t_{d,j-1})$ lies in at least one $U_i,$
  so
  \begin{align*}
    \sum v(U_i) \geq 
    \prod_{d = 1}^m \sum_{j=1}^{k(d)}(t_{d,j} - t_{d,j-1}) = 
    \prod(b_d - a_d) = v(A)
  \end{align*}
  which is positive so long as each $a_i < b_i.$
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.9}
  An unbounded set cannot have content zero, but can have measure zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  If $A$ has content zero then there is a finite cover of $A$ by closed rectangles.
  Then each point of $A$ lies in some closed rectangle, i.e. $A$ is bounded.

  The set $\{1 ,2, 3, ...\}$ is clearly unbounded, but the cover 
   $n \in [n - \frac{\varepsilon}{2^{n+1}},n + \frac{\varepsilon}{2^{n+1}} ]$
   has volume $\varepsilon$, which is as small as we like.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.10}
  A bounded set of content zero has boundary of content zero, but 
  a bounded set of measure zero may have boundary with positive measure.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}{Using results from topology.}
  Let $C$ be a bounded set, $\overline{C}$ the closure of $C$ and 
  $U_i$ a finite cover of $C$ by closed rectangles. Then $U = \cup U_i$ is a finite union 
  of closed sets, hence closed. 
  The closure of $C$ is by definition the smallest 
  closed set containing $C$.  Furthermore it can be shown that it also contains
  the bounday of $C$, whence
  $ \partial C \subset \overline{C} \subset U$ and so $\partial C$ has content zero.

  On the other hand the set $\rationals \cap [0, 1]$ is bounded and has zero measure
  but its boundary is that whole interval.

  Let $A \subset [0, 1]$ be the union over countably many intervals $(a_i, b_i)$

  Problem $1-18$ states that $\partial A = [0, 1] - A$.
  Show that if each $b_i > a_i$ then $A$ does not have zero measure.

\begin{problem}{3.13}
  Any open cover admits a countable subcover.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The first result is that the collection of `rational rectangles' - closed rectangles 
  with all rational endpoints - is countable. This is a consequence of theorem which says
  a finite cartesian product of countable sets is countable, after identifying the rectangle 
  in $\rationals^n$ with a point in $\rationals^{2n}$.

  For the main result, let $C_i$ be any open cover. For any $x$ in our set, 
  there is some $C_i$ containing $x$.  Then there is a closed rectangle $B$ with
  $x \in B \subset C_i$.  By a generalisation of the argument that any interval contains 
  infinitley many rational numbers, there is a rational rectangle $A_x$ with 
  $x \in A_x \subset B \subset C_i.$
  Then the union of all the $A_x$ is obviously a cover, which cannot be larger than $\cup_\naturals A_j$ since there are only countably many rational rectangles $A$.
  Then each $x$ is in some $A_j \subset C_j$, whence $C_j$ is a cover.

\begin{problem}{3.14}
  If $f$ and $g$ are integrable then so is $f\cdot g$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $D_f,\ D_g$ be the sets on which $f$ and $g$ are not continuous.
  Then (Theorem 3.8) both are measure zero and so (Theorem 3.4 / subaditivity of measure)
  $D_{f\cdot g} \subset D_f \cup D_g$ is measure zero.
  By Theorem 3.8 again $f \cdot g$ is integrable.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.15}
  If $C$ has content zero then $C$ is Jordan Measurable and 
  then volume of $C$ is zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Since $C$ is content zero it can be covered by finitely many closed rectangles.
  Let $a_i, b_i$ be the smallest and largest of the endpoints in each dimension,
  then define $A = \prod [a_i, b_i].$ Then $A$ contains $C$ which is therefore bounded.
  By problem 3.10 the boundary of $C$ has content zero, hence measure zero and so
  the $C$ is Jordan Measurable.

  To compute the integral take $\varepsilon > 0$ and let 
  $U_1, ..., U_n$ be some cover of $C$ which has volume smaller than $\varepsilon.$
  Let $P$ be some partition of $A$ consisting 
  of each $U$ together with other rectangles $V$.
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    L(\chi_C, P) = \sum 1 \cdot v(U) + \sum 0 \cdot v(V) = \sum v(U) < \varepsilon
  \end{align*}
  and so $\int_C 1 = 0.$

\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.16}
  The same does not hold for bounded sets of measure zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Consider $\rationals \cap [0,1].$  The set is bounded and has zero measure but 
  (becasue the boundary is large) not integrable. 
  If $P$ is any partition, then each subrectangle $S$ contains both rational and
  irrational numbers, so $M_s(\chi_C) = 1$ and $m_s(\chi_C) = 0.$  Clearly the upper and lower 
  sums over $P$ can never agree.
\end{proof}

\begin{problem}{3.17}
  If $C$ is a bounded set of measure zero and $\int_C 1$ exists then it must be zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A$ be some rectangle containing $C$ so that $\int_C 1 = \int_A \chi_C$
  and let $P$ be a partition of $A$.  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    L(\chi_C, P) = 
    \sum m(\chi_C, S)\cdot v(S) + \sum m(\chi_C, Q) \cdot v(Q) = 
    \sum v(S)
  \end{align*}
  where $S$ are the subrectangles contained in $C$ and $Q$ are the rest.
  The inclusion $S \subset C$ implies $S$ is also zero measure, and 
  so by problem 3.8 is a degenerate rectangle. This is not allowed in 
  our definition of a partition and so all subrectangles 
  are of the type $Q$, so $L(\chi_C, P) = 0$ for any partition $P$.
  We have assumed that the integral exists, and so its value must be zero.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.18}
  If $f: A\to\reals$ is non-negative and $\int f = 0$ then the
  support of $f$ has measure zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  For any integer $n$ and $\varepsilon > 0$ let $P$ be a partition with 
  $\sum M_S(f)\cdot v(S) < \varepsilon/n.$ 
  Then either $M_S(f) > 1/n$ or $M_S(f) \leq 1/n$ and so 
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{M\leq 1/n} M_S(f) \cdot v(S) + \sum_{M > 1/n} \frac{1}{n}v(S) < 
    \varepsilon/n
  \end{align*}
  from which (since both sums are finite)
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i = 1,...k} v(S_i) < \varepsilon.
  \end{align*}

  If $D_n$ is defined as  $\{ x: f(x) > 1 / n \}$ then it is surely covered by these
  $S$, which the argument above shows to be a cover of content zero.
  The support of $supp(f) = D_1 \cup D_2 \cup ...$ is a countable union of 
  measure zero sets, hence measure zero.
\end{proof}

  If $A$ is a JM set and $\varepsilon > 0$ there is a compact JM set $C \subset A$

%     C = \overline{A} - \bigcup U_i = \overline{A} \cap \big (\bigcup U_i^c\big )
%   \end{align*}
%   where $X^c$ denotes the complement of $X$ in the ambient space, $X-C$
%   and $\overline{A}$ is the closure of $A$.  $C$ is compact so it remains to show that
%   it has a small boundary.  

%   If $x$ is some point in $\partial C$ then any neighbourhood of $x$

%   If $b$ is not in $\overline{A}^c$ then it must be in a $U_i$.

  Let $A' \subset A$ be the set of $x \in A$ such that 
  $\{ y \in B: (x, y) \in C \}$ is not content zero.
  Then $A'$ is measure zero.

\begin{proof}
  By problem 3.15 $C$ is Jordan Measurable and has volume $0$.
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}{3.24}
  The result of problem 3.23 does not hold in general for sets of measure zero.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $C\subset [0,1] \times [0,1]$ be the union of all 
  $\{ p/q \} \times [0, 1]$ where $p/q$ is a rational number in $[0, 1]$ with 
  $p/q$ in lowest terms. It's a werid comb kind of thing.
  The $C$ has content zero as the bounded countable union of measure zero sets, but 
  for any $p/q$ the set $\{ y \in [0, 1]: (p/q, y) \in C \} = [0, p/q]$
  is not content zero for any $p/q$, i.e. $A'$ is all rationals in $[0,1]$, which 
  is not content zero.

\begin{problem}{3.26}
  Let $f: [a, b] \to \reals$ be integrable and non-negative and let 
  $A_f$ be the region between the graph of $f(x)$ and the $x$-axis.
  Then $A_f$ is Jordan Measurable and has area $\int_a^b f.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The boundary of $A$ consists of three bounded line segments and the graph of $f$.
  Since $f$ is integrable, it is continuous almost everywhere and so the 
  the graph is a countable union\footnote{A measure zero subset of an interval must be a countable union of singletons.}
   of continuous plane curves.  Together with 
  the obvious fact that $A_f$ is bounded establishes that $A_f$ is 
  Jordan measurable.

  Let $M$ be some upper bound for $f$.  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \mathcal{L}(x) = \int_{[0, M]} \chi_{A_f}(x, y)dy = f(x)
  \end{align*}
  and so by Fubini the volume of $A_f$ is 
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{A_f}1 = 
    \int_{[a, b]\times[0, M]} \chi_{A_f}
    \int_{[a, b]} \mathcal{L}(x) = 
    \int_a^b f.

  If $f: [a, b] \times [a, b] \to \reals$ is continuous then

  \end{align*}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $C$ be the region above the diagonal, that is 
  \begin{align*}
    \{ (x, y) : y \in [a, b]\ and \ x \in [a, y] \} = 
    \{ (x, y) : x \in [a, b]\ and \ y \in [x, b] \}.
  \end{align*}
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \int_C f = 
    \int_{[a, b], [a, b]}\chi_C \cdot f = 
    \int_{[a, b]}\bigg(\int_{[a, b]}(f\cdot \chi_C)(x, y)dy\bigg)dx = 
    \int_a^b \bigg(\int_x^b f dy\bigg)dx
  \end{align*}
  with the other side following from a similar calculation.

\begin{problem}{3.30}
  Let $C$ be the set in problem $1.17$ (the evil dense subset of the unit square 
  containing at most one point on any horizontal or vertical line.)
  Then both $\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \chi_C dydx$ and  $\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \chi_C dxdy$
  are zero but the integral over $C$ does not exist.

  In other words, the converse of Fubini's theorem does not hold in general.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  For any fixed $x$, the integral $\int_0^1\chi_C(x, y)dy$ is clearly zero since
  $C$ contains at most a single point on the line $\{x\} \times [0,1]$ from which
  it follows that the first double integral is $0$.  The argument for the other one
  is exactly the same.

  Since $C$ is dense, any rectangle contains both a point inside $C$ and
  a point outside $C$ and so $M_S = 1, m_S = 0$ for any rectangle $S$.
  Clearly the upper and lower integrals cannot coincide.

\begin{problem}{3.35}
  If $G: \reals^n \to \reals^n$ is a invertible linear transformation and $U$ a 
  rectangle, then the volume of $G(U)$ is $|\det G|\cdot v(U).$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $U = [a_1, b_1] \times ... \times [a_n, b_n]$
  and consider first of all three kinds of elementary transformations.  
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item $G$ takes one of the basis vectors $e^i$ to $ce^i$ and fixes the rest.
     If $c$ is positive then 
     \begin{align*}
       v(G(U))
       &= v([a_1, b_1]\times...\times[ca_i, c_bi]\times...\times[a_n, b_n]) \\
       &= (b_1 - a_1)\cdot...\cdot(cb_i - ca_i)\cdot ... \cdot(b_n-a_n) \\
       &= c\cdot v(U).
     \end{align*}
     The matrix representation of $G$ is the identity with the $i$-th 
     entry replaced by $c$, which has determinant $c.$ 
     If $c$ is negative then the absolute value signs are needed but 
     the volume is unchanged, although $[a, b]$ must become $[cb, ca]$. 

     \item $G$ swaps two dimensions and fixes the rest, i.e. 
     $g(e_i) = e_j$ and $g(e_j) =e_i.$
     As a matrix $G$ is the identity with zeros in the $i$ and $j$-th positions, 
     and ones in the $G_{i, j}$ and $G_{j,i}$ positions.  In $\reals^3$ it might look like
     \begin{align*}       
       \begin{pmatrix}
         1 & 0 & 0 \\
         0 & 0 & 1 \\
         0 & 1 & 0
       \end{pmatrix}
     \end{align*}
     and in any dimension larger than one has determinant $-1.$  
     Clearly this operation has no effect on the volume of the rectangle 

     \item $G$ adds basis vector to another and fixes the rest, i.e.
     \begin{align*}
       G(x^1,..., x^i,..., x^j,..., x^n) = (x^1,..., x^i + x^j,..., x^j,..., x^n).
     \end{align*}
     As a matrix $G$ is the identity with a single extra one somewhere, and so it is easy to 
     see that $\det G = 1$.


     Linear operators on $\mathbb{R}^n$ are bounded, so the volume of $G(U)$
     can be calculated as 
     \begin{align*}
       \int_{[-M_n, M_n]\times...\times [-M_1,M_1]}\chi_{G(U)}dx^1...dx^n
     \end{align*}
     for some upper bound $M$ of both $U$ and $G(U)$.  Since Fubini's theorem will allow us to interchange
     the order of integration, we can assume that $G$ 
     adds $e_2$ to $e_1$ and leaves the rest. Then $v(G(U)) = $
     \begin{align*}
       \int_{[-M_n, M_n]\times...\times[-M_3, M_3]} \bigg( 
          \int_{[-M_2,M_2]\times[-M_1,M_1]} \chi_{G(U)}(x^1, x^2, ...)dx^1dx^2
        \bigg) dx^3...dx^n.
     \end{align*}
     The value of the inner integral is the area of a parallelogram, which 
     coincides with the area of the rectangle which fell over.  Hence this inner integral 
     would not be changed by replacing $\chi_{G(U)}$ with $\chi_U.$
     Furthermore, for fixed $a^1$ and $a^2$ and varying coordinates in the 
     remaining positions, $\chi_U(a_1, a_2, x_3, ..., x_n)$ and 
     $\chi_{G(U)}(a_1, a_2, x_3, ..., x_n)$ conincide exactly.
     So for the purposes of evaulating this integral, $\chi_U$ will do 
     just as well as $\chi_{U(G)}$, or in other words their volumes are equal.
     
     \end{enumerate}

     Finally if $G$ is the composition of elementary operations as described above
     then $G$ alters the volume of $U$ by a factor of 
     \begin{align*}
        |\det G_1| \cdot .. \cdot |\det G_m| = 
        |\det G_1 \cdot ... \cdot \det G_m | = 
        |\det (G_1 \cdot ... \cdot G_m) | = |\det G|.
     \end{align*}
     We take as a fact that these elemetary operations generate the whole group 
     of invertible matrices and so this scaling factor is good for any invertible linear map.

    If each $A_c$ and $B_c$ are JM  and have the same area then $A$ and $B$
    have the same volume.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $[-M, M]^3$ be a rectangle bounding $A$ and $B$. Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{[-M, M]^3}\chi_A 
    &= \int_{-M}^M \bigg( \int_{[-M, M]^2} \chi_A \bigg)dz \\
    &= \int_{-M}^M \bigg( \int_{A_z} 1 \bigg) dz
    = \int_{-M}^M \bigg( \int_{B_z} 1 \bigg) dz \\
    &= \int_{-M}^M \bigg( \int_{[-M, M]^2} \chi_B \bigg)dz 
    = \int_{[-M, M]^3}\chi_B.

\begin{problem}{3.37}
  Suppose that $f: (0, 1) \to \reals$ is non-negative and continuous.
  Then $\int_{(0,1)}f$ exists if and only if 
  $\lim_{\varepsilon \to 0} \int_\varepsilon^{1-\varepsilon}f$ exists.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $o$ be the cover of $(0, 1)$ consisting of the intervals
  $(1/n, 1 - 1/n)$ and $\Phi$ a $C^\infty$ partition of unity for $(0, 1)$
  subordinate to $o$.
  Then each $\varphi_i$ in $\Phi$ has support contained in some 
  $(1/m_i, 1 - 1/m_i)$ in $o$.
  Choose an ordering of $\Phi$ so that if $i < j$ then $m_i \leq m_j$, that way
  the support of $\varphi_i$ is in $ (1 / m_j, 1 - 1/m_j) $ for all $j > i.$

  Then the partial sums can be written as
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{(0, 1)} \varphi_k \cdot f = 
    \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{1/m_k}^{1 - 1/m_k} \varphi_k \cdot f = 
    \sum_{k=1}^n \int_{1/m_n}^{1 - 1/m_n} \varphi_k \cdot f =  
    \int_{1/m_n}^{1 - 1/m_n} \sum_{k=1}^n  \varphi_k \cdot f =  
    \int_{1/m_n}^{1 - 1/m_n} f.
  \end{align*}
  Since $\varphi \cdot f$ is non-negative, convergence and absolute conergence
  are the same thing. Thus the extended integral exists if and only if the 
  given limit exists.
\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{3.38}
  Let $A_n$ be a closed set in $(n, n+1)$. Suppose that $f: \reals \to \reals$
  satisfies $\int_{A_n}f = (-1)^n/n$ and $f=0$ outside $A_n.$ 
  Then $f$ is not integrable.
  % Find two different partitions of unity for $\mathbb{R}$ for which 
  % the series $\sum_{\Phi} \int_{A_n} \varphi \cdot f$ converge absolutely
  % to different values.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\Phi_n$ be a partition of unity for $A_n$ and extend each 
  $\varphi$ to a function on $\mathbb{R}$ by setting $\varphi=0$ outside 
  $A_n$.
  Then their union $\Phi$ is a partion of unity for all of $\mathbb{R}$
  and 
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_\Phi \int_\mathbb{R} \varphi \cdot |f| = 
    \sum_\naturals \bigg( \sum_{\Phi_n} \int_\reals \varphi \cdot |f| \bigg) = 
    \sum_\naturals \bigg( \sum_{\Phi_n} \int_{A_n} \varphi \cdot |f| \bigg) = 
    \sum_\naturals \int_{A_n}f = -\log 2.
  \end{align*}

  Following the example in the wiki for conditional convergence, 
  define the sets 
  \begin{align*}
    B_n = A_{2n - 1} \cup A_{2(2n-1)} \cup A_{4n}
  \end{align*}
  and let $\Phi_n$ be a partition of unity for $B_n$, taking the 
  value $0$ outside $B_n$.  Then as above
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_\Phi \int_\reals \varphi \cdot |f| = 
    \sum_\naturals \bigg(\sum_{\Phi_n} \int_\reals \varphi \cdot |f| \bigg) = 
    \sum_\naturals \bigg(\sum_{\Phi_n} \int_{B_n} \varphi \cdot |f| \bigg) = 
    \sum_\naturals \int_{B_n}f.
  \end{align*} 
  Each of the integrals in the last sum has the value 
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{B_n}f
    &= \int_{A_{2n-1}}f + \int_{A_{2(2n-1)}}f + \int_{A_{4n}}f \\
    &=  \frac{(-1)^{2n-1}}{2n-1} + 
        \frac{(-1)^{2(2n-1)}}{2(2n-1)} + 
        \frac{(-1)^{4n}}{4n} \\
    &=  \frac{1}{2(2n-1)} +
        \frac{1}{4n} -
        \frac{1}{2n-1} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \bigg(
     \frac{-1}{2n-1} + \frac{1}{2n} \bigg)
  \end{align*}
  and so the sum converges to $-1/2 \log 2.$
\end{proof}

    $f(r, \vartheta) = r(\cos \vartheta, \sin \vartheta).$
    If $r(\cos \vartheta, \sin \vartheta) = r'(\cos \vartheta', \sin \vartheta')$
    then the Pythagorean identity easily gives $r = r'$, and so 
    $$\cos \vartheta = \cos \vartheta',\ \ \  \sin \vartheta = \sin \vartheta'.$$

\begin{problem}{4.1}
  Let $e_1, ..., e_n$ be the usual basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $\varphi_i$ be the dual basis.
  Then \\
  $(a) \ \varphi_{i_1} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_k} (e_{i_1}, e_{i_k}) = 1$ and
  $(b)$ $\varphi_{i_1} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_k}(v_1, ..., v_k)$ is the determinant of 
  the $k \times k$ minor of 
  $$\begin{pmatrix}v_1 \\ ...\\ v_k\end{pmatrix}$$
  obtained by selecting $i_1, ..., i_k$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  By induction on $k$.
  If $k = 1$ then $\varphi_i(e_i) = 1.$
  Assume the result for $k-1$. Then
  \begin{align*}
    (\varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}}) \wedge \varphi_{i_{k}}
    (e_{i_1}, ..., e_{i_{k-1}}, e_{i_{k}})=
    \frac{1}{(k-1)!} \sum_{S_k}sign(\sigma)(\varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}})(e_{\sigma(i_1)}, ..., e_{\sigma(i_{k-1})}) \cdot
     \varphi_{i_{k}}(e_{\sigma(i_k)}).
  \end{align*}

  Since $\varphi_{i_{k}}(e_{\sigma(i_k)})$ is one if $\sigma$ fixes $i_k$ and zero otherwise and
  $\varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}}$ is alternating this reduces to 
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{1}{(k-1)!} \sum_{S_{k-1}}sign(\sigma)(\varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}})(e_{\sigma(i_1)}, ..., e_{\sigma(i_{k-1})}) = \\
    \frac{1}{(k-1)!} \sum_{S_{k-1}}sign(\sigma)^2(\varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}})(e_{i_1}, ..., e_{i_{k-1}}) = \\
    \frac{|S_{k-1}|}{(k-1)!} \cdot  \varphi_{i_{1}} \wedge ... \wedge \varphi_{i_{k-1}} (e_{i_1}, ..., e_{i_{k-1}}) = 1
  \end{align*}
  by the inductive hypothesis.

  \begin{problem}{4.2}
    Let $f: V \to V$ be linear and $\dim V = n$.
    Then $f^*: \Omega^n(V) \to \Omega^n(V)$ is multiplication by $\det f$.
  \end{problem}

  \begin{proof}
    Let $v_1, ..., v_n$ be a basis and let $w_1, ..., w_n$ be $n$ vectors.
    Let $A$ be the matrix such that $w_i = Av_i$ and let $F$ be the matrix 
    of $f$ with respect to the basis $v_i$.  Then, taking huge liberties with 
    notation, $\omega(f(w_1), f(w_n)) = $
    \begin{align*}
      \omega(F(w_1,w_n)) = 
      \omega(FA(v_1,v_n)) = 
      \det(FA)\cdot \omega(v_1, v_n) = 
      \det F \cdot \omega(A(v_1, v_n)) = 
      \det F \cdot \omega(w_1, w_n).
    \end{align*}
  \end{proof}


  \begin{problem}{4.3}
    If $\omega$ is the volume element determined by $T$ and $\mu$ and $w_1, ..., w_n$ are vectors in $V$ then 
    \begin{align*}
      |\omega(w_1, ..., w_n)| = \sqrt{det(g_{ij})}.
    \end{align*}    
    Note that the hint for the problem has the indicies around the wrong way.
  \end{problem}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $v_1, ...v_n$ be an orthonormal basis with resepect to $T$ and $A = a_{ih}$ numbers such that 
    $w_i = \sum_{h=1}^n a_{ih}v_h$.
    Then 
    \begin{align*}
      g_{ij} := T(w_i, w_j) = \sum_{h,g=1}^n a_{ih}a_{jg}T(v_i, v_j) = \sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik}a_{jk},
    \end{align*}
    that is $(g_{ij}) = A\cdot A^T$ and
    $$\sqrt{\det G} = \det A.$$

    By theorem 4.6 we have 
    $ \omega(w_1, ..., w_n) = \det A \cdot \omega(v_1, ...v_n) = \pm \det(A)$
    (since $\omega$ is the volume element with respect to the orthonormal basis $v_i$) which proves the result.
  \end{proof}



\begin{problem}{4.4}
  If $\omega$ is the volume element of $V$ determined by $T$ and $\mu$ and
  $f: \reals^n \to V$ is an isomorphism such that $f^*T = \langle, \rangle$ and such that 
  $[f(e_1), ..., f(e_n)] = \mu$ then $f*\omega = \det.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  If $(f(e_i))$ were an orthonormal basis with positive orientation then 
  \begin{align*}
    1 = \omega( f(e_1), ..., f(e_n) ) = f*\omega(e_1, ..., e_n)
  \end{align*}
  i.e. $f^*\omega$ is the volume element in $\reals^n$.  Since this is unique it equals $\det$.

  Orthonormailty of $(f(e_i))$ follows from the easy calculation
  \begin{align*}
    T(f(e_i), f(e_j)) = f^*T(e_i, e_j) = \langle e_i, e_j \rangle = \delta{ij}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}




\begin{problem}{4.5}
    If $c: [0, 1] \to (\reals^n)^n$ is continuous and each $(c^1(t), ..., c^n(t))$ is a basis, 
    then any two have the same orientation. 
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Since $c(t)$ is a basis for any $t$ it must always be non-singular.
  Hence $\det \circ c \neq 0$ on $[0, 1]$, which means it is always 
  positive, or always negative.
  Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ be the matrices of two bases in this family, and $A$ the transformation between them. 
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \det A = \det(C^{-1}_1) \cdot \det C_2 > 0
  \end{align*}
  as the argument above ensures the determinants on the right have the same sign.
\end{proof}




\begin{problem}{4.6}
  If $v_1, ..., v_{n-1} \in \reals^n$ are linearly independent then 
  $[v_1, .., v_{n-1}, v_1 \times ... \times v_{n-1}]$ is the usual 
  orientation for $\reals^n$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  If $n=2$ then it follows from the definition that 
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      v_1 \\ v_2
    \end{pmatrix}
    \times = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      -v_2 \\ v_1
    \end{pmatrix}.
  \end{align*}
  It is clear that $\times v$ is just $v$ rotated $90$ degrees anticlockwise,
  which is the usual orientation.   To be extra sure, the matrix taking 
  $(1, 0)$ to $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(0, 1)$ to $(-v_2, v_1)$ is 
  \begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
      v_1 && -v_2 \\ v_2 && v_1
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{align*}
  which has positive determinant so long as at least one of $v$ is non-zero. \\
  \color{ForestGreen} Rest of it???

  If $\omega \in \Omega^n(V)$ is a volume element define a `cross product' in terms of $\omega$.

\begin{problem}{4.11}
  Let $f$ be a self-adjoint linear map on $V$ with respect to the inner product
  $T$.  If $v_1, v_n$ is an orthonormal basis and $A = (a_{ij})$ is the matrix of 
  $f$ with respect to $v_i$ then $A$ is symmetric.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Going straight into jumbo calculations, $T(x, f(y)) = $
  \begin{align*}
    T \bigg( \sum_i x^iv_i, f \bigg( \sum_j y^jv_j  \bigg) \bigg) =
    \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^jT(v_i, f(v_j)) =
    \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^j \sum_k a_{jk} T(v_i, v_k) =
    \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^ja_{ji}.
  \end{align*}
  By a similar calculation $T(f(x), y) = \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^ja_{ij}$.
  Since $f$ is self-adjoint we have 
  \begin{align*}
    \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^ja_{ji} = \sum_{i,j = 1}^n x^iy^ja_{ij}
  \end{align*}
  for all $x, y$, and so $a_{ij}$ must equal $a_{ji}.$
\end{proof}


















































































\begin{problem}{4.13(a)}
  If $f: \reals^{n \to m}$ and $g: \reals^{m \to p}$ then $(g \circ f)_* = g_* \circ f_*$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
      (g \circ f)_*(v_q) = 
      [D(g \circ f)(q)](v) = 
      [Dg(f(q))\circ Df(q)](v) = \\
      Dg(f(q))(Df(q)(v)) = 
      Dg(f(q)) (f_*(v_q)) = g_*(f_*(v_q))

\end{proof}


\begin{problem}{4.13(b)}
  Let $f, g : \reals^n \to \reals$. Then $d(f\cdot g) = f \cdot dg  + g \cdot df.$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{align*}
    d(f \cdot g) =
    \sum_{j=1}^n D_j(f \cdot g) \cdot dx^j = 
    \sum_{j=1}^n [f \cdot D_jg + g \cdot  D_jf] \cdot dx^j.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}{4.14}
  Let $c$ be a differentiable curve in $\reals^n$, that is, a differentiable func­tion 
  $c: [0,1] \to \reals^n$. Define the tangent vector of $c$ at $t$ as
  $v = c_*((e_1)_t) = ((c^1)'(t), ..., (c^n)'(t))_{c(t)}$.
  If $f: \reals^n \to \reals^m$, show that the tangent vector to $f \circ c$ at $t$ is $f_*(v)$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  By the previous problem the tangent to $f \circ c$ at $t$ is 
  \begin{align}
    (f \circ c)_*((e_1)_t) = f_* \circ c_*((e_1)_t) = f_*(c_*((e_1)_t)) = f_*(v).
  \end{align}
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}{4.15}
  Let $f: \reals \to \reals$ and define the planar curve $c$ by $c(t) = (t, f(t))$. 
  Show that the end point of the tangent vector of $c$ at $t$ lies on the 
  tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $(t,f(t))$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  The tangent line to the graph of $f$ at $(t, f(t))$ is 
  \begin{align*}
    L:\ \ y - f(t) = f'(t)(x - t).
  \end{align*}
  The tangent vector to the curve $c$ at $t$ is 
  \begin{align*}
    c_*((e_1)_t) = (1, f'(t))_{c(t)}
  \end{align*}
  which starts at $(t, f(t))$ and ends at 
  \begin{align*}
    H: \ \ (t+1, f(t) + f'(t)).
  \end{align*}
  It is easy to see that the point $H$ lies on the line $L$.
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}
  Let $c: [0, 1] \to \reals^n$ be a curve such that $|c(t)| = 1$ for all $t$.
  Then $c(t)_{c(t)}$ and the tangent vector to $c$ at $t$ are perpendicular.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Computing directly
  \begin{align*}
    c(t)_{c(t)} \cdot c_*((e_1)_t) = \sum c^i(t) \cdot (c^i)'(t).
  \end{align*}
  Differentiating the hypothesis $|c(t)|^2 = 1$,
  \begin{align*}
    \sum 2 \cdot c^i(t) \cdot (c^i)'(t) = 0.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}














\begin{problem}
  If $f: \reals^n \to \reals^n$, define a vector  field $\pmb{f}$ by $\pmb{f}(p) = f(p)_p$.
  Every vector  field $F$ on $\reals^n$ is of the form $\pmb{f}$ for
  some $f$ and $div \pmb{f}$ = $trace f'$
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  If $F$ is some vector field, define $f$ by $F(p) = v_p \iff f(p) = v$.
  Then\footnote{This feels sketchy.} 
  \begin{align*}
    div\pmb{f}(p) = 
    \sum D_i\pmb{f}^i(p) = 
    \sum D_i f^i(p) = 
    trace f'.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}







\begin{problem}{4.18}
  For $f: \reals^n \to \reals$ define the vector field 
  \begin{align*}
    \nabla f (p) = D_1f(p)\cdot (e_1)_p + ... D_nf(p)\cdot (e_n)_p.
  \end{align*}
  If $\nabla f(p) = w_p$ then prove that $D_vf(p) = \langle v, w \rangle$ and 
  conclude that $\nabla f (p)$ is the direction in which $f$ is changing fastest at $p$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  If $w_p = \nabla f (p) = \sum D_i f(p) \cdot (e_i)_p$ then $w = \sum D_i f(p) \cdot e_i.$
  If $v = \sum v^i \cdot e_i$ then by properties of the directional derivative
  \begin{align}
    \langle v, w \rangle = 
    \sum v^i D_if(p) = D_v f(p).
  \end{align}
\end{proof}








\begin{problem}{4.19}
  If $F$ is a vector field on $\reals^3$ define the forms 
  \begin{align*}
    \omega^1_F &= F^1 dx + F^2 dy + F^3 dz \\
    \omega^2_F &= F^1 dy \wedge dz + F^2 dz \wedge dx + F^3 dx \wedge dy. 
  \end{align*}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Prove that
    \begin{align*}
      df &= \omega^1_{\nabla f}\\
      d(\omega^1_F) &= \omega^2_{curl\ F} \\
      d(\omega^2_F) &= (div F)dx \wedge dy \wedge dz.
    \end{align*}
    \item 
    Use part (a) to prove
    \begin{align*}
      curl \ grad\ f &= 0 \\
      div \ curl \ F &= 0.
    \end{align*}
    \item 
    If $F$ is a vector field on a star-shaped set $A$ and $curl\ F = 0$, show that 
    $F = grad\ f$ for some function $f: A \to \reals$.  Similarly, if $\div\ F = 0$, 
    show that $F = curl\ G$ for some vector field $G$ on $A$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  Write $\nabla f(p) = (D_1f^1(p), D_2f^2(p), D_3f^3(p))_p.$
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    \omega^1_{\nabla f}(p) = D_1f^1(p)dx + D_2f^2(p)dy + D_3f^3(p)dz = df(p).
  \end{align*}
  The equation $d(\omega^1_F) = \omega^2_{curl\ F}$
  follows from the definitions and the facts 
  $dx^i \wedge dx^i = 0$ and $dx \wedge dy = -dy \wedge dx$.
  For the third equation 
  \begin{align*}
    d(\omega^2_F) = 
    [d_1F^1 dx \wedge dy \wedge dz] + 
    [d_2F^2 dy \wedge dz \wedge dx] + 
    [d_3F^3 dz \wedge dx \wedge dy]
  \end{align*}
  which equals $(div f) dx \wedge dy \wedge dz$
  after an even number of swaps of $dx^i$ in the latter two summands.
  \item 
  Although these are easy to prove without part (a) I guess you should do it that way to set
  up part (c).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}



\begin{problem}{4.20}
  Let $f: U \to \reals^n$ be a differentiable function with differentiable inverse
  $f^{-1}: f(U) \to \reals^n$. If every closed form on $U$ is exact, show that 
  the same is true for $f(U)$.
\end{problem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\omega$ be a form on $f(U)$ so that $f^*\omega$ is a form on 
  $U$.  Then if $\omega$ is closed
  \begin{align*}
    d(f^*\omega) = f^*(d \omega) = f^*(0) = 0
  \end{align*}
  and so $f^*\omega$ is closed, therefore exact.  Let $\mu$ be such that 
  $d(f^*\omega)= \mu$.
  Then $(f^{-1})^*\mu$ is a form on $f(U)$ and it would be nice if
  $d((f^{-1})^*\mu) = \omega$, so that $\omega$ is exact.  We have 
  \begin{align*}
    d((f^{-1})^*\mu) = (f^{-1})^*d\mu = (f^{-1})^* f^* \omega
  \end{align*}
  and so we need to show that $(f^{-1})^* f^*$ is the identity on forms.
  Since
  \begin{align*}
    (f^{-1})^*f^*\omega(f(p))(v) = \omega(f(p))(f_*f^{-1}_*(v))
  \end{align*}
  we need to show that $f_* f^{-1}_*$ is the identity on vectors.
  This follows from the inverse function theorem as follows:
  \begin{align*}
    f_*f^{-1}_*v_{f(p)} &= 
    f_*[Df^{-1}(f(p))(v)]_{f^{-1}f(p)} \\&= 
    [Df(p)\circ Df^{-1}(f(p))(v)]_{f(p)} \\&=
    [f'(p) \cdot f^{-1}{'}(f(p)) \cdot v ]_{f(p)} \\&=
    [f'(p) \cdot [f'(f^{-1}(f(p)))]^{-1} \cdot v]_{f(p)} = v_{f(p)}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}






















\begin{problem}{4.22}
  Let $S$ be the set of all $n$-cubes.  Define a singular $n$-chain as a function
  $f$ from $S$ to $\integers$ such that all but finitely many $f(c)$ are zero.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
      Define $f+g$ and $nf$ by $(f+g)(c) = f(c) + g(c)$ and $nf(c) = n \cdot f(c)$.
      Then $f+g$ and $nf$ are $n$-chains.
    \item 
      For an $n$-cube $c$ let $c$ also denote the $n$-chain which 
      is $1$ at $c$ and $0$ at every other cube. 
      Then every $n$-chain can be written as $a_1c_1 + ... + a_kc_k$
      for integers $a$ and singular $n$-cubes $n$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item 
      These are obvious.
    \item 
      Let the finite collection of cubes at which $f$ is non-zero be 
      $c_1, ..., c_k$.  Then 
      \begin{align*}
        f(c) = \sum_S f(c)c(c) = \sum_{i=1}^kf(c_i)c_i(c_i) = \bigg(\sum_{i=1}^ka_i c_i\bigg)(c)
      \end{align*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proof}









\begin{problem}{2.23}
  For $R > 0$ and $n$ an integer, define the singular $1$-cube 
  $C_{R, n} : [0, 1] \to \reals^2 - 0$ by
  \begin{align*}
    c_{R, n}(t) = (R \cos 2 \pi n t, R \sin 2 \pi n t).
  \end{align*}
  Show that there is a singular $2$-cube $c: [0,1]^2 \to \reals^2- 0$
   such that $\partial c = c_{R_1, n} - c_{R_2, n}$.
\end{problem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $c: [0, 1] \times [0,1] \to \reals^2 - 0$ be defined by 
  \begin{align*}
    c(x, y) = [(R_1 - R_2)x + R_2](\cos2 \pi n y ,\sin2 \pi n y).
  \end{align*}
  Then 
  \begin{align*}
    c_{(1, 0)}(x, y) = 
    c \circ I_{(1, 0)}(x, y) = 
    c(0, y) = 
    (R_2 \cos 2 \pi n t, R_2 \sin 2 \pi n t) \\
    c_{(1, 1)}(x, y) = 
    c \circ I_{(1, 1)}(x, y) = 
    c(1, y) = 
    (R_1 \cos 2 \pi n t, R_1 \sin 2 \pi n t).
  \end{align*}
  Since $c_{(2, 0)} = c_{(2, 1)}$ they cancel in the expanded sum of $\partial c$ leaving
  \begin{align*}
    \partial c = c_{(1, 1)} - c_{(1, 0)} = c_{R_1, n} - c_{R_2, n}.
  \end{align*}
\end{proof}
